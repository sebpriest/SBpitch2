# To Note:
This is a fork of [FCrSTATS](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/)' R Package [SBpitch](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/SBpitch/).

I took [FCrSTATS](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/)' code and made a few adjustments to fit my own needs.

# My Adjustments

From working through FCrSTATS' [tutorials](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/StatsBomb_WomensData) I wanted to incorporate a shot map function similar to the one used in [FCrSTATS](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/)' [shot map tutorial](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/StatsBomb_WomensData/blob/master/3.CreateShotMaps.md) to be able to easily reproduce these graphs myself. I called this create_SB_HalfPitch().

Additions I made were:
1. Corner arcs drawn on the graph
2. Center circle drawn on the graph
3. Center spot drawn on the graph
